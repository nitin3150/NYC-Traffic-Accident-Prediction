# NYC Traffic Accident Prediction – Big Data & Machine Learning Benchmark

This project focuses on benchmarking machine learning models for traffic accident prediction using large-scale NYC traffic data.

## 🚀 Features
- Processes 2M+ real-time traffic records using PySpark and ETL pipelines.
- Benchmarks Random Forest and XGBoost for forecasting high-risk zones.
- Includes visual performance summaries using Power BI dashboards.

## 📊 Benchmark Goals
- Evaluate model accuracy, feature importance, and training efficiency.
- Compare prediction results across different ML algorithms.
- Ensure reproducibility with well-structured data pipelines and scripts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, PySpark, Pandas
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Power BI

## 📁 Structure
- `/data`: Raw & processed traffic datasets
- `/scripts`: Model training & evaluation scripts
- `/notebooks`: Analysis and experiment logs
- `/visuals`: Power BI dashboards and charts

## 📌 Reproducibility
Ensure Python 3.8+ and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
Run `python scripts/train_and_evaluate.py` to reproduce benchmark results.

## 📈 Sample Output
- Model Accuracy: 80%+
- Reduced incident prediction error by 25%
